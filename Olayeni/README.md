My Digital Drinking Buddy (minimum viable product)

My Digital Drinking Buddy is an application that allows users to log and track their alcohol consumption. It can be run through XCode or on any IOS device. 

When you first open the application, you will be at a login screen. If you have already created an account, you can sign in by passing in your username and password. If you do not have an account, click the "Sign Up Here" button below the sign in buttom. This will bring you to the account creation screen, where you must enter in a username, weight, gender, and password. On this screen, you will be asked to type and retype a password; they must match. 

After you create an account, return to the login screen and enter in the username and password of the account you just created. After logging in you should be at the Alcohol Diary page. If you have just created the account, this page will be empty. If you look at the tabbed page control at the bottom of the page, you will see 2 other sections aside from Diary: Drinks and Profile. If you click Drinks, you will see a list of alcoholic brands. The top of this page has a search bar so you can search up any kind of alcoholic beverage you want. When you click on a brand, you are taken to a sub page that includes the title of the brand, its type (wine, beer, rum, vodka, etc), and its aBV. The subpage also includes an entry for the user to type in the number of servings (standard drinks) of that brand the consumed. After typing that number in, the user can click the button "Log into Diary" to add the drink to his/her diary. A "success" alert will pop up if all works as intended.

After logging a drink into the diary, you can look back at the diary tab (by clicking the "Diary" button on the tabbed control at the bottom of the page) to see the diary entry. If you do not see the entry, pull down to refresh the page, and it will appear at the top (the diary entries are arranged by most recent at the top to oldest at the bottom. Each entry contains 3 bits of information (the date and time in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format) that the entry was logged, the brand of alcohol consumed, and the number of servings (standard drinks) you consumed.

The "Profile" button in the tabbed control take you to your profile page. This page shows your username at the top, followed by your gender and weight. Below all this is your BAC, which is calculated using your weight, gender, and diary entry information. The current version of this app, however, does not yet include the functionality for the BAC calculation. It also does not yet have the functionality to edit information like your weight or to change information in diary entries.

When you are done using the app, you can log out by clicking the Logout button on the top left corner of the "Drinks" page. This will take you back to the login screen.
